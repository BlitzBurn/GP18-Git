Today we're going to learn about [Git](https://git-scm.com), a [version control](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), and the [GitHub](https://yrgo.github.io/services/github) [open source universe](https://github.com/open-source). Did you know [Apple](https://github.com/apple), [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) and [Google](https://github.com/google) all share parts of their source code on [GitHub](https://github.com)? Sharing is caring!

> **Note:** If you haven't yet signed up for the [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) on GitHub I suggest you do that [as soon as possible](https://i.giphy.com/lRnUWhmllPI9a.gif). [GitHub](https://yrgo.github.io/services/github) is going to be a part of your everyday workflow here at [Yrgo](https://yrgo.github.io). Don't forget to [add your school email address](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account) to your GitHub account.

## Assignments part one

1. First sign up for an [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

2. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and login to your GitHub account.

3. [Create a new repository on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository), name it `hello-world`.

4. [Clone the repository with GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop/) and open up the project in your favorite editor.

5. Create a new [Markdown](https://yrgo.github.io/languages/markdown) file and call it [`README.md`](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis).

6. Add a new [`<h1>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) (in Markdown) at the top of the [README](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis) file and write the text `Hello World`.

7. Back in GitHub Desktop, add a new commit message/summary and [commit your changes to master branch](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project).

8. [Push your changes to GitHub](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/syncing-your-branch/).

9. You should now see your changes appear on your repository page on GitHub.

## Assignments part two

1. In GitHub Desktop, create a new [branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_(version_control)) in your repo and name it `Feature`.

2. Make sure the new branch is your current working branch.

3. Open your project in your file manager, add a new file and name it `my-awesome-feature.txt`.

4. Back in GitHub Desktop, add and commit your changes to your Feature branch.

5. Your file manager will now reflect the current working branch.

6. Merge the feature branch into the master branch.
